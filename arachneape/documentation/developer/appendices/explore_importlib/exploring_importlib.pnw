Exploring Importlib
===================

Despite the title, this isn't (at least initially) an exploration of importlib as much as an attempt to see if other packages can be passed in to the plugin discovery system.

.. currentmodule:: importlib
.. autosummary:: 
   :toctree: api

   import_module

To make this self-contained I'm creating a package below this directory that will be installed but (hopefully) won't get picked up as part of this package.
