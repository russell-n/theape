The Base Plugin
===============
.. currentmodule:: arachneape.plugins.base_plugin

.. _base-plugin:
Background
----------

This module contains a `BasePlugin` class that forms the foundation of the `arachneape` plugin-system. Creating a `BasePlugin` makes it easier to add code as it provides a concrete target for the person adding the code, removes the need for the infrastructure code to be changed when plugins are added, and encourages documentation by providing a built-in online help-interface and auto-included `rst` files.

In order to create a child of the `BasePlugin` you are required to implement two properties and one method: ``sections``, ``product``, and ``fetch_config()``. The ``sections`` and ``fetch_config`` are for the user-interface while the ``product`` should be the object to run. The ``sections`` can be ``None`` if you do not want the online help, but should otherwise be a dictionary with section-names as keys and content-strings as values. It will be passed to the :ref:`HelpPage <help-page>` so you should see that if you want to know what will be done with the ``sections`` property. If the ordering is important use a ``collections.OrderedDict``. The
``fetch_config`` is expected to be a method that sends a sample config-file snippet to stdout. I chose stdout rather than to disk because it allows the user to append it to existing files using redirection ``>>`` and it also serves as a prompt for those who just need to remember what the configuration should look like (I also had problems with users accidentally clobbering their configurations by pulling sample files). The ``product`` should be the built-object for the code to run (only the ``__call__`` method will be used so that has to be implemented on the ``product``). When the child-plugin is implemented, it will be passed a :ref:`ConfigurationMap <configuration-map>` that will provide data-types pulled from whatever configuration file it was given for the plugin to use in configuring the product.

The :ref:`QuarterMaster <quarter-master>` looks for child-classes of the `BasePlugin` when deciding what is a valid plugin, so besides defining an implementation expectation for the new plugin, the `BasePlugin` also provides the means for inclusion in the `arachneape` (even if you drop a module in this folder, if nothing in it is a child of the `BasePlugin` it will be ignored). To check if it contains a `BasePlugin` the module has to be imported so be careful with globals and imports.

The `BasePlugin` class and the ``plugins`` package also provides the foundation for user help. As noted above, the ``sections`` and ``fetch_config`` are meant for online help and in addition to this the ``index.pnw`` file contains code to include any ``rst`` files in the ``plugins`` directory so adding documentation files here will add the text to the documentation when it is regenerated::

   Pweave index.pnw

To summarize, the `BasePlugin` is the main way to add code that will be exposed to the end user.

Public Properties and Methods
-----------------------------

The following are the public propeties and methods. The ``help_page`` and ``help()`` are the only implemented attributes, the rest need to be implemented by the inheriting classes.
