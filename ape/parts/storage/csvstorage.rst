The CSV Storage
===============

Although python already has a csv-writer in order to make be able to drop it into the places where the regular file storage is expected I need to add an adapter around it.

::

    # python standard library
    import copy
    import csv
    from types import DictType
    
    # the ape
    from ape import BaseClass
    from ape import ApeError
    import ape.parts.storage.filestorage
    
    



The CSVDictStorage
------------------

Role
~~~~

    * Maintains file (and file path)

    * Writes header to file before beginning data-writing

    * adds `writerow` method to the normal storage that takes a dictionary of 'column':'value' pairs.

Collaborators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * csv.DictWriter

   * Storage

CsvDictStorage Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Constructor
+++++++++++++++

The constructor accepts three parameters:

   * `headers`: a list of column headers (required for the DictWriter)
   * `path`: A string path to save files to (folder-level only, the `open` method takes the filename as an argument)
   * `storage`: A file-like writeable object

Either `path` or `storage` is required, if the `storage` isn't given one will be created frome the path.

.. '

The open Method
+++++++++++++++

This follows (more or less) the open method for the regular file-storage in that it returns a copy if itself but with  the storage replaced with a copy that has the filename passed in as an argument and the ``writer`` attribute set to a ``csv.DictWriter``.

The Path:

   #. Copy self
   #. Open file
   #. Create DictWriter with opened file and self.headers
   #. Write the headers
   #. Set copy of self's `storage` to opened file
   #. Set copy of self's  `writer` to created DictWriter
   #. Return copy of self

The writerow Method
+++++++++++++++++++

This is a pass-through to the DictWriter's writerow method.
