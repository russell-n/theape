.. _ape-thebigsleep-parameters:

The Parameters
--------------

`TheBigSleep` takes three parameters -- `end`, `total`, and `interval`.

    * The `interval` is the amount of time to sleep between printing status messages to the screen.

    * The `end` is a datetime set to the time (and date) to end

    * The `total` is a timedelta set to amount of time in the future to end

Either the `ape` or the `total` needs to be set and if you set both the `total` will be ignored in favor of the `end`.

.. csv-table:: TheBigSleep end and total
   :header: ``end``, ``total``, Outcome

   None, None, ApeError raised
   None, timedelta, ``now() + total`` used
   datetime, None, ``end`` used
   datetime, timedelta, ``end`` used

The Class Model
---------------

.. uml::

   TheBigSleep -|> Component
   TheBigSleep: datedtime.datetime end
   TheBigSleep: datetime.timedelta total
   TheBigSleep: float interval
   TheBigSleep o-- EventTimer
   TheBigSleep: __call__()
   TheBigSleep : check_rep()
   TheBigSleep : close()


.. currentmodule:: ape.parts.sleep.sleep
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   TheBigSleep
   TheBigSleep.end
   TheBigSleep.total
   TheBigSleep.zero
   TheBigSleep.timer
   TheBigSleep.then
   TheBigSleep.emit
   TheBigSleep.check_rep
   TheBigSleep.close
   TheBigSleep.__call__

.. note:: This might only have come about because I started using the EventTimer to prevent over-eager access to a server, rather than trying to use it to space intervals, but it didn't occur to me originally that the times have to be calculated in the method that is wrapped by the `wait` decorator, because the wait comes before the method call, leaving it 1-second or so behind the time it was called.
