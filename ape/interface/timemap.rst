Relative Time Map
-----------------

The `RelativeTimeMap` maps strings of relative times to seconds. It tries to be as liberal as possible so there has to be a fair amount of certainty that the string is in fact a time and not something similar but different. '5 yolks' will match '5' years, for instance, and if that is not the desired behavior than something else has to do a check first to filter out bad strings.
