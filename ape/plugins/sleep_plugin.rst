Sleep Plugin
============

.. _sleep-plugin:

This is a plugin for :ref:`The Big Sleep <ape-big-sleep>`, code that does nothing but countdown. I guess it could be called count-down... Anyway.

.. uml::

   Component <|-- TheBigSleep
   TheBigSleep : __init__(end, total, interval, verbose)
   TheBigSleep : __call__()

   TheBigSleep



The Configuration
-----------------

`TheBigSleep` has four parameters in its arguments so the configuration text will mirror that.

::

    configuration = """
    [{0}]
    # 'end' should be a timestamp for the end-time (11-12-2013 8:45 pm)
    # 'total' should be a timestamp for the run-time (1 hr 23 minutes)
    # 'interval' should be <amount> <units> (1 minute)
    # if verbose is False, sceen output will be off except at startup
    # only one of absolute or relative time is required, although both can be used
    {1} = <absolute time>
    {2} = <relative time>
    {3} = 1 second
    {4} = True
    """.format(SLEEP_SECTION, END_OPTION,
               TOTAL_OPTION,
               INTERVAL_OPTION,
               VERBOSE_OPTION)
    



The Sections
------------

The help-sections.

::

    sections = OrderedDict()
    sections['name'] = '{bold}sleep{reset} -- a countdown timer that blocks until time is over'
    sections['description'] = '{bold}sleep{reset} is a verbose no-op (by default) meant to allow the insertion of a pause in the execution of the APE. At this point all calls to sleep will get the same configuration.'
    sections['configuration'] = configuration
    sections['see also'] = 'EventTimer, RelativeTime, AbsoluteTime'
    sections['options'] = """
    The configuration options --
    
        {bold}end{reset} : an absolute time given as a time-stamp that can be interpreted by `dateutil.parser.parse`. This is for the cases where you have a specific time that you want the sleep to end.
    
        {bold}total{reset} : a relative time given as pairs of '<amount> <units>' -- e.g. '3.4 hours'. Most units only use the first letter, but since `months` and `minutes` both start with `m`, you have to use two letters to specify them. The sleep will stop at the start of the sleep + the total time given.
    
        {bold}interval{reset} : The amount of time beween reports of the time remaining (default = 1 second). Use the same formatting as the `total` option.
    
        {bold}verbose{reset} : If True (the default) then report time remaining at specified intervals while the sleep runs.
    
    One of {bold}end{reset} or {bold}total{reset} needs to be specified. Everything else is optional.
