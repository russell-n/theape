Exploring Trace
===============

Trace is a python module to track python statement execution.

.. currentmodule:: trace
.. autosummary:: 
   :toctree: api

   Trace

The ``trace`` module itself has a command-line interface so you can run code::

    python -m trace <filename>

but here I am more interested in the ``Trace`` class that you can import to run a trace from within your code. It seems to be meant to be used for code-coverage but I am interested in it to track function calls so that is all that I will explore here.

.. toctree::

   Default Trace <default_trace>
   countfuncs <countfuncs>
   countcallers <countcallers>
   runfunc <runfunc>
