Code2Flow Explorations
======================

This is a look at what `code2flow <https://github.com/scottrogowski/code2flow>`_ does. It does not appear to be on pypi but you can use git to get it and do the usual installation::

   git clone https://github.com/scottrogowski/code2flow.git
   cd code2flow
   python setup.py install

A dump of the ``--help``:

.. literalinclude:: code2flow_help.txt

A fairly minimal interface.

<<name='imports', echo=False>>=
# python standard library
import subprocess
import shlex

# this package
import ape.plugins.apeplugin as plugin
@

<<name='hortator', wrap=False>>=
file_name = plugin.__file__.rstrip('c')
command = 'code2flow --language py -o plugin_flow.png {0}'.format(file_name)
subprocess.call(shlex.split(command))
@

.. image:: plugin_flow.png

It does not seem to be as successful as pyreverse in finding things.
