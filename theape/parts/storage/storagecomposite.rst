The Storage Composite
=====================

In order to support multiple output-targets, a Composite will be used to store Storage objects. This is intended to be the main interface for storage. Although it is called a Composite, this differs from the main Composite class used by the Ape to run the code in that it cannot use the `__call__` method (or it can, but it needs to take arguments).

.. uml::

   StorageComposite -|> BaseClass
   StorageComposite : storages
   StorageComposite : write(text)
   StorageComposite : writelines(lines)
   StorageComposite : close()                    
   StorageComposite : open(name)
   StorageComposite : open_storages
   StorageComposite : add(storage)
   StorageComposite : remove(component)

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   StorageComposite
   StorageComposite.storages
   StorageComposite.write
   StorageComposite.writelines
   StorageComposite.close
   StorageComposite.open
   StorageComposite.add
   StorageComposite.remove
   check_opened

The ``StorageComposite`` maintains a list of file-like objects and, once ``open`` is called, a list of opened file-like objects.
