The APE (Read Me)
=================


The `All-Purpose Experimenter` is a plugin-based system meant to create a unified front-end for different device-related testing. 

Installation
------------

If you have the repository you can install it by using the ``setup.py`` file.

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install

Alternately you can pull it from Pypi.

.. code:: bash

   pip install theape

If you are installing it system-wide you will probably have to prefix this and other install commands with ``sudo``.

Documentation
-------------

The APE has some online help.

.. code:: bash

   ape -h

Installing Testing Dependencies
-------------------------------

The APE is currently being tested using `behave <http://pythonhosted.org/behave/>`_ so if you want to run the tests, you'll need that, `pyhamcrest <http://pyhamcrest.readthedocs.org/en/1.8.0/>`_ and `mock <http://mock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/magicmock.html>`_. All three are on pypi so if you have pip installed you can install them from the web (if installing system wide run as root).

.. code:: bash

   pip install behave
   pip install pyhamcrest
   pip install mock
