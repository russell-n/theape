This is documentation meant to help use (run) this code. Although it is meant for an end-user and not a programmer, I think that understanding some of the implementation will help create a mental model to guide you in using it so I will mention it now and again, but for more detail you should see the :ref:`APE Developer Documentation <ape-developer-documentation>` instead.
